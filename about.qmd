## Project Loon

### Abstract

The purpose of this dataset is to offer an estimate of the horizontal momentum fluxed vertically by the atmospheric internal gravity waves (GWs) observed by Project Loon balloons. This vertical flux of horizontal momentum is commonly referred to as the GW momentum flux. Before estimating the GW momentum fluxes, additional processing was necessary to remove data sampling errors, irregularities, and balloon maneuvering.

### Methodology

The procedures for this processing, and the subsequent analysis of the processed data, are described in Green et al. (2024). The Python code (in Jupyter notebooks) that was used for both is available at: <https://github.com/DataWaveProject/Loon-momentum-fluxes>.

### Usage notes

See the following sample project for examples: <https://redivis.com/projects/q08b-889vc3xgg>.

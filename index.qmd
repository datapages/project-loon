# subtitle: "A great dataset for data exploration & visualization"
description: |
  The purpose of this dataset is to offer an estimate of the horizontal momentum fluxed vertically by the atmospheric internal gravity waves (GWs) observed by Project Loon balloons. This vertical flux of horizontal momentum is commonly referred to as the GW momentum flux. Before estimating the GW momentum fluxes, additional processing was necessary to remove data sampling errors, irregularities, and balloon maneuvering.
